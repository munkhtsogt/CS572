1. When do we use those 2 functions?
setImmediate(): It executes it's callback immediately after I/O events callbacks.
setTimeout(): It doesn't execute it's callback immediately. It will executed after specific delay.  
If setTimeout's delay is 0 and it is queued before setImmediate then setTimeout will executed before setImmediate.
On the other hand setImmediate will always executed before setTimeout.

2. Difference?
process.nextTick(): It fires immediately on the same phase.
setImmediate(): It fires on the following iteration or 'tick' of the event.
process.nextTick() & setImmediate are similar to each other. However process.nextTick fires more immediately 
than setImmediate. In general setImmediate is more recommended to developers.
